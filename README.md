## About

this repo is used for teaching me, about pytorch, i decided to wrappe pytorch
functions, and all the load and the preparations of datasets, in wrappers to hide
some of the complexity of those functions. refers to the code, to know more.  

## Contents

- `data` folder containing all the dataset of mnist for classification of numbers
- `models` folder containing the trained models
- `html` folder containing the saved sessions of some of the jupyter qtconsole runs in html format
- `utils.py` python module for all the functions
